# GameCoExcel
CareerFoundry data analytics introductory course project for a fictitious gaming company GameCo.

GameCo is a new video game company that has hired me to use its video game data to inform the development of new games and foster a better understanding of how GameCo's new games might fare in the market. GameCo's board has the intial impression that video game sales have stayed the same over time in all world geographical regions.

I used Excel to clean, group, summarize, and analyze game sales data to answer specific business questions related to total sales figures, how sales differed over time and between geographical regions, and how game genres differed in popularity. I put together a final market budget presentation to analyze historical and current video game market trends, review and revise GameCo’s current understanding of the market, and recommend actions to maintain and increase GameCo’s future profitability.
